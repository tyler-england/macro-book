# macro-book

Excel workbook I can use to run macros as part of external programs

- Email Info (gets quote/machine/sales info for quotes from open email)
- Export Modules (allows me to export VBA modules from other workbooks)
- Error Report (sends me an email -- called when a user encounters an error with a program I wrote)
